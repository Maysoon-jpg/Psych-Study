- Made study website to help with psychology revision
- Found that after doing many exam questions i would soon forget the exam skill needed for the questions I got wrong (what I got wrong etc), so didn't perform as well in exams.
- Created this website which helps me log the most important questions with all the answers I have done along with the mark schemes and what I have done wrong in the past for that question.
- Also helped me log the exam skill i frequently forgot about, it would be useful to breifly look at before an exam.
- Features shown in gif. (editing text, deletion, adding images, flagging questions etc.)
- Completed within 1 week.
